This project is an experiment to generate audio from mp3 file via deep learning

## Know Issues
- the audio generated is with lots of noise (it has been found that if there isn't any transformation on the read wav file, there won't been quality loss in the generated file)
- The training model doesn't work at all, need a way to debug it.
- The way to deal with fourier transformed sequence should be evaluated
